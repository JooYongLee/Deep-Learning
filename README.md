# Deep-Learning
Deep Learning Algorithm

after reading "pb files", it starts classification.
this tutorial is based on the simple CNN(LeNet)
pb file is created by "Export_Tf.py" module.
If pb file is cretaed completely, i can import the graph and weights from OpenCV functioni with "readNetfromTensorflow".
this is very simple tutorial.
